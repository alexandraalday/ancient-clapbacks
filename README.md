## Ancient Clapbacks
http://alexandraalday.com/ancient-clapbacks/

I completed this for the Free Code Camp's Random Quote Generator project. I knew I wanted to use some spicy ancient quotes, but there was no easy way to pull those from an online source. So I added the quotes I could remember and looked up a few more from texts I remembered getting a chuckle from in school. 

Click on the gorgon's head and a random quote appears for you to tweet if you really want to impress your friends with quotes like these.

**Technologies Used:** 
* HTML
* CSS 
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Twitter's widget.js

**Design**
* Bootstrap

I really wanted to keep the design simple and practice a bezier curve animation when the user hovers over the image. 

### Future Features 
 - [ ] Needs a better quote bank, perhaps from data scraping.
